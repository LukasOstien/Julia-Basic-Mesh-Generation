# Julia-Basic-Mesh-Generation
A series of functions used to generate quasi-uniform rectangular and circular meshes. 
This was heavily inspired by the much more sophisticated library [iFem](https://github.com/lyc102/ifem), written by Long Chen, a professor I had the privelege of having when taking a PDEs class at UC Irvine.
