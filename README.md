# Basic Mesh Generation for Julia
A series of functions used to generate quasi-uniform rectangular and circular meshes. If desired, a function to uniformly refine a mesh is provided. When refining a circle mesh, enforceGeometry.jl can be used to enforce the geometry of a circle.<br>
This was heavily inspired by the much more sophisticated library for Matlab, [iFem](https://github.com/lyc102/ifem), written by Long Chen, a professor I had the privelege of having when taking a PDEs class at UC Irvine.
